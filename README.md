# nfexplorer

## Description
*nfexplorer* is a webpage and CGI shell script that is used in combination with
[nfdump](https://github.com/phaag/nfdump) tools to display netflow/ipfix
flow data.  The webpage makes use of
[bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs) for CSS formating and responsive pages and
[dygraph](https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs) for the displaying of flows in a
graphical form.  The *nfquery.cgi* accepts the webrequests from the page and
formats then runs the nfdump command to dump existing flows.
